# FatalError: Nova Support Fluent Signature Mismatch

## Description
A fatal server error occurs when running the "Add to Next Action" action in Laravel Nova. The error log is as follows:

```
{
  "userId": 1,
  "exception": {
    "class": "Symfony\Component\ErrorHandler\Error\FatalError",
    "message": "Declaration of Laravel\\Nova\\Support\\Fluent::fill(array $attributes) must be compatible with Illuminate\\Support\\Fluent::fill($attributes)",
    "code": 0,
    "file": "/var/task/vendor/laravel/nova/src/Support/Fluent.php:19"
  },
  "aws_request_id": "346c4d11-2269-4aab-9d91-1c07231eb525"
}
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to Laravel Nova admin panel.
2. Run the "Add to Next Action" action.
3. Observe the server error.

## Suspected Cause
A method signature incompatibility between `Laravel\Nova\Support\Fluent::fill` and `Illuminate\Support\Fluent::fill`. This may be due to a version mismatch between Laravel Nova and the core Laravel framework.

## Next Steps
- Confirmed: Project uses Laravel 11 and Nova 4.x (not compatible).
- Latest compatible Nova version for Laravel 11 is Nova 5.x.
- Upgrade Nova to 5.x for compatibility with Laravel 11.
- Update `composer.json` requirement for `laravel/nova` to `^5.0`.
- Run `./vendor/bin/sail composer update laravel/nova` to upgrade Nova.
- Test the Nova admin panel and "Add to Next Action" feature.

## Solution
Upgrade Laravel Nova to version 5.x, which officially supports Laravel 11. This resolves the method signature incompatibility and ensures continued compatibility with the latest Laravel framework.
