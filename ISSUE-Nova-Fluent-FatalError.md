# FatalError: Nova Support Fluent Signature Mismatch

## Description
A fatal server error occurs when running the "Add to Next Action" action in Laravel Nova. The error log is as follows:

```
{
  "userId": 1,
  "exception": {
    "class": "Symfony\Component\ErrorHandler\Error\FatalError",
    "message": "Declaration of Laravel\\Nova\\Support\\Fluent::fill(array $attributes) must be compatible with Illuminate\\Support\\Fluent::fill($attributes)",
    "code": 0,
    "file": "/var/task/vendor/laravel/nova/src/Support/Fluent.php:19"
  },
  "aws_request_id": "346c4d11-2269-4aab-9d91-1c07231eb525"
}
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to Laravel Nova admin panel.
2. Run the "Add to Next Action" action.
3. Observe the server error.

## Suspected Cause
A method signature incompatibility between `Laravel\Nova\Support\Fluent::fill` and `Illuminate\Support\Fluent::fill`. This may be due to a version mismatch between Laravel Nova and the core Laravel framework.

## Next Steps
- Confirmed: Project uses Laravel 11 and Nova 4.x (not compatible).
- Latest compatible Nova version for Laravel 11 is Nova 5.x.
- Upgrade Nova to 5.x for compatibility with Laravel 11.
- Update `composer.json` requirement for `laravel/nova` to `^5.0`.
- Run `./vendor/bin/sail composer update laravel/nova` to upgrade Nova.
- Test the Nova admin panel and "Add to Next Action" feature.

## Solution
Upgrade Laravel Nova to version 5.x, which officially supports Laravel 11. This resolves the method signature incompatibility and ensures continued compatibility with the latest Laravel framework.

## Test-Driven Bug Fixing Plan
To prevent this issue from reoccurring and to catch similar regressions in the future, we will:
1. Implement a Laravel Dusk browser test to simulate the "Add to Next Action" workflow in Nova.
2. Confirm the test fails due to the current bug (fatal error).
3. Apply the fix (upgrade Nova to 5.x).
4. Re-run the browser test to confirm the issue is resolved.
5. Keep the test in the suite to detect future regressions before they reach production.

This approach ensures confidence in the fix and maintains long-term stability for this Nova action.
