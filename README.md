# Daily Driver

A modern Laravel 11 application with Nova 5 admin panel, automated browser testing, and fully automated CI/CD deployments on AWS Lambda (Vapor) using PHP 8.3 and ARM for cost and performance efficiency.

- The Tech Leads page now displays a random, user-relatable career challenge message as the main heading, in double quotes and italics, on each page load. This feature is fully covered by automated and browser tests. See documentation below.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Laravel 11** with first-class Sail (Docker) support
- **Nova 5** for powerful admin/resource management
- **Automated Dusk browser tests** for critical workflows
- **CI/CD via GitHub Actions** for both staging and production (no manual deploys)
- **Serverless deployment** on AWS Lambda using Laravel Vapor (PHP 8.3, ARM)
- **Composer-managed dependencies** (including PHP 8.3-only packages)

### üìñ Features & Usage
For a detailed breakdown of Nova admin features and workflows, see [docs/NOVA-FEATURES.md](docs/NOVA-FEATURES.md).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- PHP 8.3 (ARM on production/staging)
- Laravel 11
- Laravel Nova 5
- Laravel Sail (Docker)
- Laravel Vapor
- MySQL, Redis
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Dusk (browser testing)

---

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PHP 8.3+ (if running outside Sail)
- Composer v2
- Node.js & npm/yarn (for asset compilation)

### Setup
```sh
# 1. Clone the repo
 git clone https://github.com/wilng2005/daily-driver.git
 cd daily-driver

# 2. Copy env and install dependencies
 cp .env.example .env
 ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
 ./vendor/bin/sail composer install
 ./vendor/bin/sail npm install && ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev

# 3. Generate app key & run migrations
 ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
 ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate

# 4. (Optional) Seed the database
 ./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow
- **Start the app:** `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
- **Stop the app:** `./vendor/bin/sail down`
- **Run tests:** `./vendor/bin/sail test`
- **Run browser tests (Dusk):** `./vendor/bin/sail dusk`
- **Generate coverage report:** `./vendor/bin/sail test --coverage-html=./coverage-report`
- **Access Nova:** `/nova` (local dev, after running migrations)

---

## ‚úÖ Code Coverage Policy
- This project enforces 100% code coverage as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- For generic error handling (e.g., logging and rethrowing in catch blocks), we use `@codeCoverageIgnoreStart`/`@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd` to pragmatically exclude these lines from coverage, as they do not contain business logic.
- All other logic is fully covered by automated tests, following TDD principles.

---

## üö¢ Deployment
- **Staging:** Push to `staging` branch triggers CI/CD and deploys to Vapor (uses PHP 8.3 ARM runtime)
- **Production:** Push to `main` branch triggers CI/CD and deploys to Vapor (uses PHP 8.3 ARM runtime)
- **No manual `vapor deploy` required**‚Äîall deployments are automated via GitHub Actions
- **Vapor config:** See `vapor.yml` for environment/runtime details

---

## üõë Troubleshooting & Common Issues
- **Composer install fails?** Ensure you are using PHP 8.3+ (some dependencies require it)
- **GitHub Action not triggering?** Make sure workflow files exist in the target branch before merging. Fast-forward/no-op merges or missing workflow files can prevent triggers.
- **Dusk/Selenium errors?** Make sure Sail and all containers (including Selenium) are running before testing.
- **Manual deploy discouraged:** Always use CI/CD for both staging and production.
