### üìö Features & Usage
For a detailed breakdown of Nova admin features and workflows, see [docs/NOVA-FEATURES.md](docs/NOVA-FEATURES.md).

#### Insights Module (Nova)
- Manage insights and their sections from the Nova admin panel
- Fields: title, description, keywords (JSON), published_at, sections (hasMany)
- Section fields: header, markdown, image path, background color, order
- Full CRUD, ordering, markdown editing, and publication control
- 100% test coverage and TDD enforced for all CRUD and publication logic

#### API Endpoints
- **GET /api/todos** ‚Äî Search todos by query string (requires API token)
- **GET /api/next-actions** ‚Äî Returns all captures where `next_action=true`, sorted with captures having `priority_no=null` first, then ascending by `priority_no`. Secured by the same API token middleware as `/api/todos`. See OpenAPI schema at `/api/open-ai/schema` for details.
- **POST /api/captures** ‚Äî Create a new capture (todo) item. Requires `name` and `content` in the JSON body. Optional fields: `priority_no`, `inbox`, `next_action`. Requires API token in the `X-API-Token` header. See OpenAPI schema at `/api/open-ai/schema` for full request/response details and validation rules.
- **PUT /api/captures/{id}** ‚Äî Update a capture by ID. Only `name`, `content`, `priority_no`, `inbox`, and `next_action` are updatable. Requires API token. See OpenAPI schema for request/response structure, validation, and security details.
- **DELETE /api/captures/{id}** ‚Äî Soft delete a capture by ID. Marks the capture as deleted (using Laravel SoftDeletes) without removing it from the database. Requires API token. Returns 204 No Content on success. See OpenAPI schema at `/api/open-ai/schema` for details.
- **GET /api/open-ai/random-number** ‚Äî Generate a random integer in a given range (public endpoint). By default, returns a number between 1 and 12 (simulates a 12-sided die). Accepts optional `min` and `max` query parameters. See OpenAPI schema at `/api/open-ai/random-number/schema` for full details.

For instructions on using this endpoint inside ChatGPT or as a plugin/tool, see:

## ‚ö° Getting Started

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow

- Insights and their sections are managed via Nova admin resources
- All CRUD and publication logic for insights is covered by automated feature tests (see `InsightTest`)
- TDD and 100% code coverage are enforced for this feature

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PHP 8.3+ (if running outside Sail)
- Composer v2
- Node.js & npm/yarn (for asset compilation)

### Setup
```sh
# 1. Clone the repo
 git clone https://github.com/wilng2005/daily-driver.git
 cd daily-driver

# 2. Copy env and install dependencies
 cp .env.example .env
 ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
 ./vendor/bin/sail composer install
 ./vendor/bin/sail npm install && ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev

# 3. Generate app key & run migrations
 ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
 ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate

# 4. (Optional) Seed the database
 ./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow


### Database Reset & Seeding

To reset your database and seed it with sample data for local development/testing:

```sh
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This will:
- Drop all tables and re-run all migrations
- Truncate the posts table and insert example data (manual & AI, published & draft)

Use this workflow to demo, test, or develop with real data.

---

### Updating main.css (Custom Styles)

All custom styles for the application are managed in `public/sass/main.css`.

To update or add styles:
1. Edit `public/sass/main.css` and save your changes.
2. Rebuild frontend assets using Sail and Vite:
   ```sh
   ./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
   ```
3. Refresh your browser to see the changes. (You may need to clear your browser cache for CSS changes to appear.)

**Note:**
- Always commit both your updated CSS and any relevant Blade/template changes.
- If you encounter build errors, try removing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `./vendor/bin/sail npm install` before rebuilding.

### Commands
- **Start the app:** `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
- **Stop the app:** `./vendor/bin/sail down`
- **Run tests:** `./vendor/bin/sail test`
- **Run browser tests (Dusk):** `./vendor/bin/sail dusk`
- **Generate coverage report:** `./vendor/bin/sail test --coverage-html=./coverage-report`
- **Access Nova:** `/nova` (local dev, after running migrations)
- **Before deploying or opening a PR:** Always run the code coverage report locally and ensure 100% coverage before pushing. Do **not** wait for CI/CD to catch coverage failures. Use `./vendor/bin/sail test --coverage-html=./coverage-report` and open `coverage-report/index.html` to verify.

---

## ‚úÖ Code Coverage Policy
- The project enforces 100% code coverage for all API endpoints and business logic. Any new or updated endpoint (such as `PUT /api/captures/{id}`) must be accompanied by comprehensive feature tests.
- For time-dependent logic, use Carbon freezing (see `DoDailyScheduleTest.php`) to ensure deterministic coverage.
- Test-driven development (TDD) is the preferred workflow for all bug fixes and features.

- This project enforces 100% code coverage as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- All new endpoints (including `/api/next-actions`) must be fully covered by automated feature tests before merging.
- Test for `/api/next-actions` ensures correct filtering and sorting logic for next-action captures, as described in the issue documentation.
- For generic error handling (e.g., logging and rethrowing in catch blocks), we use `@codeCoverageIgnoreStart`/`@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd` to pragmatically exclude these lines from coverage, as they do not contain business logic.
- All other logic is fully covered by automated tests, following TDD principles.

## üö¢ Deployment
- **Staging:** Push to `staging` branch triggers CI/CD and deploys to Vapor (uses PHP 8.3 ARM runtime)
- **Production:** Push to `main` branch triggers CI/CD and deploys to Vapor (uses PHP 8.3 ARM runtime)
- **No manual `vapor deploy` required**‚Äîall deployments are automated via GitHub Actions
- **Vapor config:** See `vapor.yml` for environment/runtime details

---

## üõë Troubleshooting & Common Issues
- **Composer install fails?** Ensure you are using PHP 8.3+ (some dependencies require it)
- **GitHub Action not triggering?** Make sure workflow files exist in the target branch before merging. Fast-forward/no-op merges or missing workflow files can prevent triggers.
- **Dusk/Selenium errors?** Make sure Sail and all containers (including Selenium) are running before testing.
- **Manual deploy discouraged:** Always use CI/CD for both staging and production.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt / Multi-User Limitation

> **Single-user Limitation:**
> The current API hardcodes `user_id = 1` for all newly created captures (see CaptureController@store). This is a temporary workaround because only one user exists in production. The system is **not** ready for multi-user environments. A future redesign will be required to support multiple users, including proper authentication, user context, and per-user data isolation.
