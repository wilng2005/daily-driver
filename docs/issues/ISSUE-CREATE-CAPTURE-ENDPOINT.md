- **OpenAPI schema**: `/api/open-ai/schema` now documents this endpoint in detail.
- **README**: Project documentation is updated with usage, authentication, and request/response info.
- **CI/CD**: All tests pass in CI and the endpoint is deployed.
- **Closure:** This issue is now closed as of 2025-05-19.

## Status
- **Type:** Feature
- **Stage:** Complete
- **Created:** 2025-05-19
- **Closed:** 2025-05-19
- **Related:** `Capture` model, `api/captures` endpoints, `CaptureController`

---

## Summary
Add a new API endpoint to create a Capture (todo item) via `POST /api/captures`. This will allow clients to programmatically add new captures to the system, supporting integrations and user workflows.

---

## Motivation
- Current API only supports listing, updating, and retrieving captures; creation is missing.
- Enables integration with external tools, bots, or frontends that need to add new tasks/captures.
- Aligns with RESTful API best practices.

---

## Requirements
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/captures`
- **Auth:** Requires `X-API-Token` header (same as other protected endpoints).
- **Payload:** JSON object with the following fields:
  - `name` (string, required, max 255): Title or label for the capture.
  - `content` (string, required): Body/description (markdown supported).
  - `priority_no` (integer, optional, nullable): Priority number (nullable).
  - `inbox` (boolean, optional): Whether the item is in the inbox. Defaults to `true` if omitted.
  - `next_action` (boolean, optional): Whether the item is a next action. Defaults to `true` if omitted.
- **Validation:**
  - `name`: required, string, max 255
  - `content`: required, string
  - `priority_no`: integer, nullable, min 0
  - `inbox`: boolean (optional, defaults to true)
  - `next_action`: boolean (optional, defaults to true)
- **Response:**
  - `201 Created` with the created Capture as JSON on success
  - `422 Unprocessable Entity` with validation errors
  - `401 Unauthorized` if missing/invalid token

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Endpoint exists at `POST /api/captures` and is protected by API token middleware
- [x] Valid requests create a new Capture and return it as JSON (`201`)
- [x] Only `name` and `content` are required; all other fields are optional
- [x] If `inbox` or `next_action` are omitted, they default to `true`
- [x] Invalid requests return appropriate validation errors (`422`)
- [x] Unauthorized requests are rejected (`401`)
- [x] OpenAPI schema is updated
- [x] README and CHANGELOG are updated
- [x] Feature and validation tests exist for this endpoint

---

## Implementation Plan
1. Write/extend feature test for creating a capture
2. Add `store` method to `CaptureController`
3. Add route in `routes/api.php` under `api.token` middleware
4. Add request validation (FormRequest or inline)
5. Update OpenAPI schema
6. Update README and CHANGELOG

---

## Notes
- Follow conventions from the update endpoint for validation and response structure.
- Ensure automated tests and CI pass before merging.
