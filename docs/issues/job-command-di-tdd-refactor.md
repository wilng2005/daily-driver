# Issue: Refactor Job Commands for Testability and TDD

**Status:** âœ… Closed & Completed (as of 2025-04-23)


## Context

Previously, the scheduled job commands (`SendJournalEntry`, `SendReacquisitionMessages`) in this Laravel project directly used Eloquent model static methods (e.g., `TelegramChat::all()`). This made it difficult to test these commands using TDD, as mocking static methods in Laravel feature tests is brittle and often requires process isolation or alias mocking, which can cause conflicts and break the application container.

Additionally, some feature tests were failing or required awkward workarounds to assert logging and error handling in these jobs. The codebase also had some lint errors and coverage gaps related to these patterns.

## What Was Done

- **Introduced Dependency Injection for Job Commands:**
  - Created a `TelegramChatProvider` interface and an `EloquentTelegramChatProvider` implementation.
  - Refactored `SendJournalEntry` and `SendReacquisitionMessages` to accept a `TelegramChatProvider` via constructor injection, replacing direct calls to `TelegramChat::all()`.
  - Bound the interface to the Eloquent implementation in `AppServiceProvider` for seamless production usage.

- **Updated Feature Tests for TDD:**
  - Refactored feature tests to inject a mock `TelegramChatProvider` directly into the command instances.
  - Removed the need for alias mocking and `@runInSeparateProcess` annotations.
  - Tests now assert both success and failure logging scenarios in a clean, maintainable way.

- **Improved Code Coverage Reporting:**
  - Added `@codeCoverageIgnore` to provider implementations where appropriate, as these are infrastructure-only and covered indirectly.
  - Ensured all business logic and error handling in job commands is fully tested.

- **Lint and Documentation Improvements:**
  - Fixed lint errors related to undefined types.
  - Proposed updating documentation to describe the new pattern and rationale.

## Why This Was Done

- **Testability:**
  - Dependency injection allows for reliable, isolated, and fast tests, in line with TDD best practices.
  - Removes reliance on brittle mocking techniques and process isolation.

- **Maintainability:**
  - The codebase is easier to extend, refactor, and reason about.
  - Future contributors can follow a clear pattern for writing testable job commands.

- **Coverage and Code Quality:**
  - Business logic is now fully covered by automated tests.
  - Coverage ignores are used judiciously for infrastructure code, keeping reports meaningful.

## Next Steps

- Apply this pattern to other commands or services as needed.
- Update project documentation to describe this approach and its benefits.
- Continue using TDD for new features and refactors.
