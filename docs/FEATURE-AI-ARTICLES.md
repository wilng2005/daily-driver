# Feature Plan: AI-Generated Articles Section

## Overview
This feature introduces an Articles section to the greater.than.today website, focused on relevant coaching topics (burnout, productivity, stress management, personal crisis, etc). Articles will be routinely auto-generated by an AI workflow, reviewed in the Nova admin panel, and published upon approval. Manual article generation (with custom prompts) will also be supported.

## Milestones & Next Steps
1. **Design Article Model & Migration:**
   - Finalize Article fields, statuses, and relationships.
   - Write model and migration tests (TDD-first).
   - Create migration and Eloquent model.
2. **Implement Nova Resource for Article:**
   - Scaffold Nova resource with CRUD and review workflow.
3. **Build Public Articles Section:**
   - Implement routes, controllers, and views for listing and viewing articles.
4. **Integrate AI Article Generation Service:**
   - Choose AI provider and define API contract.
   - Implement service and write integration tests (mock AI where possible).
5. **Implement Scheduled Article Generation:**
   - Add Laravel scheduled task to propose articles weekly.
6. **Add Manual Article Generation Trigger in Nova:**
   - Allow admin to trigger AI generation with custom prompt.
7. **Implement Admin Review & Approval Workflow:**
   - Approve, edit, or reject articles in Nova; publish on approval.
8. **(Optional) Add Audit Trail & Notifications:**
   - Track article actions and notify admin of new proposals.
9. **Document Feature in README/NOVA-FEATURES.md:**
   - Update documentation as feature evolves.

## Goals
- Provide high-quality, relevant, and regularly updated coaching articles.
- Automate article generation using AI (scheduled and on-demand).
- Ensure all articles are reviewed and approved before publication.
- Empower admin (coach) to manage, edit, and trigger article creation via Nova.

## User Stories
1. **As a visitor**, I can browse and read coaching articles on the website.
2. **As an admin**, I can review, edit, approve, or reject AI-generated article drafts in Nova.
3. **As an admin**, I can trigger AI to generate a new article on a chosen topic or prompt.
4. **As an admin**, I am notified when new article drafts are proposed.
5. **As an admin**, I can see an audit trail of article review and publishing actions (optional).

## Functional Requirements
- Article model with status (proposed, draft, published, rejected), title, content, topic, author, timestamps.
- Nova resource for Article with review and publishing workflow.
- Public-facing articles section (list, view, search).
- AI integration for scheduled and manual article generation.
- Scheduled task to propose a new article weekly.
- Admin notification of new article proposals.
- Audit trail for article actions (optional).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- TDD: All features covered by automated tests.
- Secure admin access (Nova policies).
- Robust error handling and logging for AI integration.
- Documentation updated as feature evolves.


## TDD & CI/CD Notes
- Write model, feature, and integration tests for each milestone.
- Mock AI service in tests.
- Use Dusk for browser-based admin workflow tests.
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline covers all new tests.

## Open Questions
- Which AI provider/service to use for article generation?
- Should articles be tagged/categorized for easier browsing?
- Should rejected articles be archived or deleted?
