## Changes Made
### Image Asset Reference Updates
All references to the following image assets were updated to their new versioned filenames to ensure the latest images are served:

| Old Reference                | New Reference                |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| asset-1.png                  | asset-1v2.png                |
| asset-2.png                  | asset-2v2.png                |
| asset-3.png                  | asset-3v2.png                |
| asset-4.png                  | asset-4v2.png                |
| asset-5.png                  | asset-5v2.png                |
| asset-6.png                  | asset-6v2.png                |
| asset-7.png                  | asset-7v2.png                |
| asset.png                    | assetv2.png                  |

All changes were made within Blade template files using the `{{ asset('images/...') }}` helper.

## Rationale
- Ensures the UI uses the latest image assets for improved visuals and branding.
- Avoids caching issues and ensures all users see the updated images.

## Next Steps
- Review the UI in the browser to verify all images load correctly.
- Commit and push changes after verification.
- Continue with additional UI/UX improvements as needed.
